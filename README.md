# OpenSubdiv-Model-Fitting
Fitting subdivision surfaces to data.

Implements the main ideas in our CVPR 2016 tutorial (http://awf.fitzgibbon.ie/cvpr16_tutorial), but this is bare-bones code at the moment.  Please use only if you're confident you can fix bugs due to compiler inconsistencies etc.  I would love for someone to make it more polished, but if we wait until then, it may take forever for the code to be released.

Given that...
